I tried my absolute best to try and figure out why my site wasn't showing.

It deploys properly with Heroku(I checked the Heroku logs and everything multiple times)

It works fine when you start up the server and the react app locally.

I've tweaked everything multiple times. I've looked at others doing the exact same thing I've been doing on Youtube. 

I must have googled the entire web history on the topic by now.

It just wont show!

I'm not even joking I'm going crazy. I don't know what the reason is. 

If you don't believe me, just take a peak at my github deployment activity log here

Please let me know if you have figured out why my deployment isn't showing correctly. And if not I don't blame you. I'd rather restart the whole thing again and deploy from the beginning so that I know it atleast shows on the web but I don't have the time. :(

Anyways that's all for my rant
